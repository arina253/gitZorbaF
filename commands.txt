Command prompt

C:\Users\joshi\Onedrive\Desktop> mkdir gitZorbaF
C:\Users\joshi\Onedrive\Desktop> cd gitZorbaF
C:\Users\joshi\Onedrive\Desktop\GITZorbaF> git .code

Visual studio open  --------two files created---commands.txt and info.txt

C:\Users\joshi\Onedrive\Desktop\GITZorbaF>git init ------> git commit -m"added"
Open git hub.login and create a new repository named gitZorbaF
Copy and paste last three code.
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com.arina253/gitZorbaF.git
git push u origin main
Now, we can see the code in remote repo

If made some changes in the remote repo,then need to pull changes via request pull icon
git pull -m origin main
We can see code changes in local repo

NOTE:
We shouldn't touch the local main branch directly.
From local main,we will create other branch,work on it and push our local repo
At github,merge your code from remote repo to main branch and pull it again so that we have updated code.

git branch
git branch branchName, eg.git branch A
git branch- to check the current branch
git checkout A- to switch to branch A
Make/Write some changes in local repo
git add .
git commit -m"changes from A branch"
git push origin A ----- transfer complete branch from local to repo

git log - to check last commit
pull request from git hub
Merge
Delete branch A from local repo

git checkout main ----inorder to delete branch A,come to the main branch first
git branch -D A
git branch-----to check the branch if the A branch is deleted

Local needs to be updated with recent changes
git pull origin main------update code in local repo
